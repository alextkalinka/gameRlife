#' 
#' Run the cellular automata Game of Life.
#' 
#' @param seed An nx2 matrix containing the co-ordinates of `n` seeds for the game.
#' @param num_gens An integer specifying the number of generations of evolution in the game.
#' @param board_size An integer specifying the size of the 2D array. Defaults to 50.
#' 
#' @return Each generation of the game is returned as a data frame that contains co-ordinates for only the living cells. Mainly used for the side-effect of animating the cellular automata as they evolve.
